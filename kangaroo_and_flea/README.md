Imagine a kangaroo whose tail is tied to a pole via an infinitely stretchy rubber band.
Also imagine a flea sitting atop that pole.

The rubber band starts at length `0`.
The kangaroo jumps one meter, stretching the band to length `1 m`.
The flea then jumps one centimeter onto the stretched band.
The kangaroo then takes another jump of `1 m` (carrying the flea along as the band stretches).
The flea then jumps another `1 cm` down the band.
And so on.

Does the flea ever catch up to the kangaroo?
