Imagine a kangaroo with an infinitely stretchy rubber band tied to its tail at one end and a pole at the other end.
Also imagine a flea sitting atop the pole.

The rubber band starts at length 0.
The kangaroo jumps one meter, stretching the band to length 1m.
The flea then jumps one centimeter onto the stretched band.
The kangaroo then takes another jump of 1m (carrying the flea along as the band stretches).
The flea then jumps another 1cm down the band.
And so on.

Does the flea ever catch up to the kangaroo?
