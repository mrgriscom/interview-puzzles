Imagine a row of 100 lockers, all closed, labeled 1 to 100 in order.

A person makes a pass down the row, opening each locker.
They then make a second pass, closing every other locker (i.e., lockers whose number is divisible by 2).
Then another pass, where for every third locker, closing it if open, or opening it if closed (call this "toggling" the locker).
Then again toggling every 4th locker, every 5th, and so on, until 100 passes have been completed.

How many lockers are left open at the end?
